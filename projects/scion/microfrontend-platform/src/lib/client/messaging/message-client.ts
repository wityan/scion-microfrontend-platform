/**
 * Message client for sending and receiving messages between applications across origins.
 *
 * This message client offers pub/sub messaging to microfrontends in two flavors: `Topic-Based Messaging` and `Intent-Based Messaging`.
 * Both models feature the request-response message exchange pattern, let you include message headers, and support message interception to implement
 * cross-cutting messaging concerns.
 *
 * #### Topic-based Messaging
 * Topic-based messaging allows publishing a message to a topic, which then is transported to consumers subscribed to the topic. Topics
 * are case-sensitive and consist of one or more segments, each separated by a forward slash. When publishing a message to a topic, the
 * topic must be exact, thus not contain wildcards. Messages published to a topic are transported to all consumers subscribed to the topic.
 * Consumers, on the other hand, can subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously by using wildcard segments in the topic.
 *
 * The platform supports publishing a message as a retained message. Retained messages help newly-subscribed clients to get the last message
 * published to a topic immediately upon subscription. The broker stores one retained message per topic. To delete a retained message, send a
 * retained message without a body to the topic. Deletion messages are not transported to subscribers.
 *
 * #### Intent-based Messaging
 * Intent-based messaging focuses on controlled collaboration between micro applications. It is inspired by the Android platform where an application
 * can start an Activity via an Intent (such as sending an email).
 *
 * This kind of communication is similar to the topic-based communication, thus implements also the publish-subscribe messaging pattern, but additionally
 * requires the sending application to declare an intention in its manifest. Unlike topic-based communication, the message (also called the intent) is
 * exclusively transported to micro applications that provide a fulfilling capability through their manifest.
 *
 * In intent-based communication, the destination are capabilities, formulated in an abstract way, consisting of a a type, and optionally a qualifier. The
 * type categorizes a capability in terms of its functional semantics (e.g., microfrontend if representing a microfrontend). A capability may also define
 * a qualifier to differentiate the different capabilities of the same type. The type is a string literal and the qualifier a dictionary of key-value pairs.
